       "This error means your Langchain installation is outdated or corrupted. The `init_chat_model` function was removed or reorganized in a later version of Langchain.  You need to update Langchain to a version that's compatible with your code, or modify your code to use the new API.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's how to troubleshoot and fix the problem:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Update Langchain:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The most likely solution is to update your LangChain package.  Open your command prompt or terminal and run:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "pip install --upgrade langchain\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "or, if you use conda:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "conda update -c conda-forge langchain\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "After the update, restart your Python interpreter or IDE.  This should resolve the issue if the problem was simply an outdated version.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Check your code:**\n",
       "\n",
       "If updating Langchain doesn't work, examine the code where you're using `init_chat_model`.  The function is no longer the standard way to initialize chat models in recent Langchain versions.  You likely need to instantiate a chat model directly using a class like `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatAnthropic`, or another specific model.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, if you were previously using:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n",
       "\n",
       "chat = init_chat_model(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\") \n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "You should replace it with something like this (assuming you're using OpenAI):\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n",
       "\n",
       "chat = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0) \n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember to install the necessary OpenAI package:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "pip install openai\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "And set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).  Consult the Langchain documentation for the specific parameters and requirements of the chat model you're using.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Verify your installation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Check your `pip` or `conda` environment:** Make sure you're using the correct Python environment where you installed Langchain.  Use `pip freeze` or `conda list` to see the installed packages.\n",
       "* **Reinstall Langchain:**  If you suspect a corrupted installation, try uninstalling and reinstalling Langchain:\n",
       "   ```bash\n",
       "   pip uninstall langchain\n",
       "   pip install langchain\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "* **Check for conflicting packages:**  Sometimes, conflicting packages can cause issues.  If you're still having trouble, try creating a new, clean virtual environment before installing Langchain.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Consult Langchain documentation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The official Langchain documentation is your best resource. Check the release notes and API reference for the current version to see the correct way to initialize chat models.  Search for examples related to the specific chat model you're trying to use.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "If you've followed these steps and are still encountering the error, please provide the following information so I can assist you further:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **The exact code snippet** where the error occurs.\n",
       "* **The output of `pip freeze` or `conda list`** showing your installed packages.\n",
       "* **The version of Langchain** you're using (check with `pip show langchain` or `conda list langchain`).\n",
       "* **The specific chat model** you are trying to use.\n",
       "\n",

       "### **Step-by-Step Process to Build a Data Chatbot for AWS SQL Server**\n",
       "\n",
       "#### **Phase 1: Data & Database Preparation (Data Scientist Focus)**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 1: Understand Your Data and Schema**\n",
       "Before writing any code, you need a deep understanding of your AWS SQL Server database schema.\n",
       "*   **Identify Key Tables:** Which tables hold information about employees, cases, projects, etc.?\n",
       "*   **Identify Key Columns:** What are the relevant columns in those tables (e.g., `employee_id`, `employee_name`, `project_id`, `project_name`, `case_id`, `case_status`, `case_date`)?\n",
       "*   **Understand Relationships:** How are these tables linked (e.g., `employees` to `cases` via `employee_id`, `projects` to `cases` via `project_id`)?\n",
       "*   **Sample Data:** Have sample data available for testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *Example Tables (Hypothetical):*\n",
       "    *   `Employees`: `employee_id (PK)`, `employee_name`, `department`\n",
       "    *   `Projects`: `project_id (PK)`, `project_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`\n",
       "    *   `Cases`: `case_id (PK)`, `employee_id (FK)`, `project_id (FK)`, `case_description`, `status`, `created_date`\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 2: Database Connectivity & Security**\n",
       "You'll need a way for your back-end application to connect securely to your AWS SQL Server.\n",
       "*   **Credentials:** Store database credentials (hostname, port, database name, username, password) securely. AWS Secrets Manager is an excellent choice for this. Avoid hardcoding.\n",
       "*   **Network Access:** Ensure your back-end application (wherever it's hosted) has network access to your AWS SQL Server instance (e.g., through Security Groups, VPC peering).\n",
       "*   **Least Privilege:** Create a database user with only the necessary read-only permissions on the tables the chatbot needs to query.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### **Phase 2: Back-end Development (Data Scientist / Software Engineer Focus)**\n",
       "\n",
       "The back-end is the brain of your chatbot. It handles natural language understanding, SQL generation, database interaction, and response formatting.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) Engine**\n",
       "This is the most critical and complex part. You need to convert a user's natural language question into an executable SQL query.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Approach A: Rule-Based / Template-Based (Simpler, Less Flexible)**\n",
       "    *   **Intent Recognition:** Identify the user's intent (e.g., \"count cases,\" \"find projects,\" \"get employee details\"). You can use libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK` for keyword extraction or simple rule matching.\n",
       "    *   **Entity Extraction:** Extract specific entities like `employee name`, `project name`, `date ranges`, `status` from the user's query.\n",
       "    *   **SQL Template Mapping:** Map recognized intents and entities to predefined SQL query templates.\n",
       "        *   *Example:* If intent is \"count cases\" and entities are `employee_name=\"John Doe\"` and `project_name=\"Alpha\"`, construct a query like:\n",
       "            ```sql\n",
       "            SELECT COUNT(C.case_id)\n",
       "            FROM Cases C\n",
       "            JOIN Employees E ON C.employee_id = E.employee_id\n",
       "            JOIN Projects P ON C.project_id = P.project_id\n",
       "            WHERE E.employee_name = 'John Doe' AND P.project_name = 'Alpha';\n",
       "            ```\n",
       "    *   **Pros:** Full control, less dependency on external APIs, good for limited, well-defined questions.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Hard to scale, new question types require code changes, not truly \"natural language.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Approach B: Large Language Models (LLMs) - Recommended for Flexibility**\n",
       "    *   Leverage powerful pre-trained LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models, Google's Gemini, Hugging Face models like Code Llama) to generate SQL.\n",
       "    *   **Prompt Engineering:** The key is to provide the LLM with:\n",
       "        1.  **Database Schema:** Explain your table names, column names, data types, and relationships.\n",
       "        2.  **User Question:** The natural language query.\n",
       "        3.  **Instructions:** Tell the LLM to generate a valid SQL Server query based on the schema and question.\n",
       "        4.  **Examples (Few-Shot Learning):** Provide a few examples of NL questions and their corresponding SQL queries to guide the LLM.\n",
       "    *   **Pros:** Highly flexible, can handle variations in language, understands context better, scales to new question types without extensive re-coding.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** API costs (if using external models), potential for hallucination (generating incorrect SQL), security concerns (ensure generated SQL is safe before execution), performance can vary.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 4: Database Interaction Layer**\n",
       "This component executes the generated SQL and fetches results.\n",
       "*   **Python Library:** Use `pyodbc` for connecting to SQL Server.\n",
       "*   **Execution:**\n",
       "    *   Receive the SQL query from the NL2SQL engine.\n",
       "    *   **Crucial Security Step: SQL Injection Prevention:** If you're not using a full-fledged ORM and relying on raw SQL generated by an LLM, you *must* validate the generated SQL or ensure the LLM is constrained not to generate malicious queries (e.g., `DROP TABLE`). A common practice is to only allow `SELECT` statements and filter out any `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, etc.\n",
       "    *   Execute the query and fetch results.\n",
       "*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases like:\n",
       "    *   Invalid SQL generated by the NL2SQL engine.\n",
       "    *   Database connection errors.\n",
       "    *   No data found for the query.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 5: Response Generation**\n",
       "Convert the SQL query results into a user-friendly natural language response.\n",
       "*   **Simple:** \"John Doe has completed 5 cases for the Alpha project.\"\n",

       "*   **Guardrails:** Implement strict guardrails around LLM-generated SQL to prevent harmful queries (e.g., only `SELECT` statements, no `DROP`, `DELETE`, etc.).\n",
       "*   **Ambiguity Handling:** What if a question is ambiguous? Your bot should ideally ask clarifying questions. (This adds complexity to NL2SQL).\n",
       "*   **Data Masking/Anonymization:** If your data contains sensitive information, consider data masking before returning results, or limit the chatbot's access to only non-sensitive subsets.\n",
       "*   **Performance Tuning:** Complex natural language queries can translate into complex SQL. Ensure your database is indexed appropriately for common query patterns.\n",
