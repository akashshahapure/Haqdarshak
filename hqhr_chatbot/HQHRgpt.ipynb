       "*   A formal process to address and improve employee performance gaps, providing a structured opportunity for the employee to demonstrate capability.\n",
       "*   Initiated *after* regular feedback, training, and other interventions have been attempted and documented.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Scope:**\n",
       "*   Applies to all employees (including Fellows, Consultants, and Interns).\n",

       "**Grounds for PIP:**\n",
       "*   Consistent lag in performance/not meeting deliverables or targets.\n",

       "    *   HR initiates only after mentoring, training, and feedback are exhausted and documented.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Initiating a PIP:**\n",
       "    *   LM shares performance details with HR.\n",
       "    *   HR verifies data, validates grounds, and issues a formal PIP notice with clear, measurable deliverables and timelines.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Post-PIP Actions:**\n",
       "    *   **Mid-review call:** LM assesses progress, employee can raise concerns, deliverables may be revised.\n",

       "*   Other actions: Skill upgrade, training, transfer, role change, or demotion.\n",

       "*   **Exclusions:** PIP is *only* for performance issues; behavioral/ethical concerns are handled under the Code of Conduct.\n",
       "*   **Documentation:** All discussions, reviews, and outcomes must be documented via email.\n",
       "*   **Impact:** PIP documentation is recorded in the employee file and may impact future development programs or appraisals.\n",
